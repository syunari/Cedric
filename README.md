## Project introduction
Have you heard of the serverless Top 10 vulnerabilities that OWASP announced in 2021? They defined security threats that will occur during serverless operations. We need to focus on the "S9 - Known Vulcan Components" vulnerabilities. This vulnerability was defined as the 9th vulnerability, but the recent increase in exploitation cases through SW supply chain vulnerabilities such as SolarWinds and Log4j has led to increased interest in Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which means software components.

**"ALTRPS"** is Approach to Lambda Threat Response Process with SBOM, a project to address the "S9 - Known Vulgarable Components" of the serverless top 10 vulnerabilities announced by OWASP in 2021. AWS Serverless is a process of extracting vulnerabilities based on the Inspector SBOM specification and distributing update layers for them.
